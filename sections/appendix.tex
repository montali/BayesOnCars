\section{Report Instructions}
\label{sec:appendix}
Your technical report should focus on the work that you have done in the project. Additionally, you should also provide brief descriptions of the components/parts that you rely on in your work. Make sure to describe everything in your own words!

This template includes the basic structure for your final technical report. You should keep the overall structure by not changing the \textit{sections}. You can still adjust the structure a bit by adding \textit{subsections}. In the appendix, you find these instructions as well as some \LaTeX{} examples. Before you hand in the report, makes sure you have deleted all \textit{lipsum} fillings and the instructions/examples from the appendix.



\subsection*{Abstract}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maximum length: 10 lines!
    \item Important: Do not put references into the abstract
    \item Content of the abstract:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Punchline
        \item Introduction. Why should I care?
        \item What is the problem? How did you tackled the problem?
        \item How did you go about doing the research that follows from your idea?
        \item Whatâ€™s the key impact of your research?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Main Part}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Main Part consists of 6 sections: Introduction, Dataset, Methodology, Methods, Evaluation, Conclusion
    \item Maximum(!) length without figures/tables: 3 pages
    \item Suggested length with figures/tables: 4 pages
    \item Additional content should be put in appendix.
    \item Content in appendix must not be required to understand the main part.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item General introduction of the problem that you were trying to solve. 
    \item What is the brief problem description? 
    \item Why is it important/interesting/challenging? 
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Dataset}
\begin{itemize}
    \item General description of the dataset that you were using. 
    \item Important details about the dataset. 
    \item What modifications/preprocessing did you do (if any)? Only mention things here that you used for all of your methods later, e.g., resizing, cropping, or combining images. 
    \item What are the details of the final modified dataset that you used. 
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What do you want to do? What kind of problem is it?
    \item What is the dataset?
    \item What is the input of each part?
    \item What is the output of each part?
    \item What is/are the metric/s you want to evaluate on?
\end{itemize}
% protocol, metric, etc.

Remember: show your reader the wall before you begin to examine the bricks.

% Methodology (protocol, metric, etc.)
% a. If you tackled the project by solving two problems, describe the two methodologies here.

\subsubsection*{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Methods that you tried
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluation of the methods with the described metric
    \item Comparison of your methods
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conclusion of your work
    \item What is working? What does not work? Where could your methods be improved?
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Appendix}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Additional content can be put in the appendix.
    \item Appendix must not be required to understand the main part.
    \item You should still not dump all images and data into the appendix. You should make a selection of useful additions.
    \item Appendix is not required.
\end{itemize}
