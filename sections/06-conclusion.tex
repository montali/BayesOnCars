\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have seen how Bayesian Networks can prove themselves as an extraordinary tool to summarize complex probabilistic domains. This could step up the process of decision making in multiple situations, while still being intrinsically elegant and simple. Tools like \texttt{pgmpy} make the whole job a breeze: the programmer just has to think about the data, the computer will do the rest. That probably is how a truly \textit{intelligent} system would perform. We have then seen how exact inference is - while still being computationally heavy - a great tool, and, moreover, how we can use \textbf{approximate inference} to achieve similar results with less, less work.
